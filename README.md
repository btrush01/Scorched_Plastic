This is my first step in coding HTML, CSS, JS, and other tools necessary to create a functional and aesthetic website. I would describe this as a work in progress, as it’s not yet what I had envisioned when I started coding. However, for now, it sufficiently touches upon all the criteria needed to pass this semester, which is most important after all. Because of this, I will label this form of the project 1.0 pre-alpha. Flavor text explaining the rules in detail needs to be added, some unused images still need to be added, and perhaps additional tools will be implemented should they become useful, but the base is here.

Version History:

-1.0 pre-alpha-

+basic functionality in the form of a JS navbar implemented

+CSS styling of various elements coded, though not all are yet implemented

+lightbox interactivity implemented for images in the “Unitsand Accessories” tab

+flexbox used to organize the units within the “Units and Accessories” tab into logical columns

+Media Queries implemented to make site responsive to differing in resolution screens
