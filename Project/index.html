        What it is and Why
      </p>

      <p class="p1">
        If you're like me, you grew up playing with little Plastic Army Men, but
        as the years passed, I found myself wanting something more sophisticated
        than throwing marbles at the opposing side. Still, it's Plastic Army Men;
        simplicity should be the name of the game. Yet, rulesets I found for
        organized tabletop play were all overly complex, so I made my own. This
        site will teach the absolute basics of the game, which I have named
        "Scorched Plastic". That means, we are playing mostly on a soldier vs
        soldier level, with few to no vehicles. However, because of the ease in
        obtaining the stereotypical Tim Mee figures upon which this game is based,
        building larger forces is more feasible than with typical expensive
        wargaming figures.
